## On API Choices: 
ref-https://rapidapi.com/collection/list-of-free-apis  



## Ideas - descending order of difficulty:  
### 1: A movie lookup using:
https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/imdb8/  
https://rapidapi.com/rapidapi/api/movie-database-imdb-alternative/  
User gives us names of an actor, director etc, we return list of movies  
+ We could let the user sort by IMDB rating, year produced etc  
+ We can check if the movie is available on netflix in your current country  
https://rapidapi.com/rasiqueira/api/netflix-unofficial/  
and on disney+  
https://disneyapi.dev/docs  

### 2: A language translator  
User provides text and desired language  
https://rapidapi.com/googlecloud/api/google-translate1/  
browser reads out the new language  

### 3: A cocktail recipe maker using:  
https://rapidapi.com/thecocktaildb/api/the-cocktail-db/  
User selects ingredients from a list and we return what they can make  
+ We could do some cool things with image styling with this one  

### 4: A currency converter using:  
https://rapidapi.com/warting/api/currency-converter/  
User inputs a to and from currencies, and we return the converted value  
+ We could look up historic trends for context i.e. is this a good time to exchange or should you wait?
